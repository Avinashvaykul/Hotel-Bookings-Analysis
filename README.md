# Hotel-Bookings-Analysis And Cancellation Prediction

Project Overview:
This project analyzes hotel booking data, performs time series forecasting, and builds machine learning models to predict booking cancellations.

Features:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

Time Series Analysis:
Forecasting hotel bookings using AR, MA, ARMA, and ARIMA models.

Evaluating models using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE metrics.

Machine Learning Models for Cancellation Prediction:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting

Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
